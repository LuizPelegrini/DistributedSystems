Iterative development of a server/client communication, during my Fourth Year at Universidade Federal de Uberl√¢ndia.
In short terms, the objective is creating a simple version of the HTTP Protocol in a local web server, in order to make the communication between server and client possible. Currently, the Firefox RESTED plugin is being used to perform the HTTP requests, so please, ignore client.c by now.

This project is still in progress.

It is based on the "Beej's Guide to Network Programming" instructions, so far.
The guide can be found at http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/
